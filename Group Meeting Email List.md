prompt:  
a few updates to the attendee list:
Manmeet has moved to Western Kentucky University as a faculty member. He can be removed from the weekly list. As a courtesy, you may reach out to him to see if he would like to continue receiving the weekly emails. If he declines, that is perfectly fine; if he agrees, there is no obligation for him to attend regularly.
Jagger (graduated with a PhD, now pursuing a medical PhD at a new university) and Sui (graduated with a PhD and currently seeking a postdoc or faculty position) fall into the same category. Please check with them to see if they want to continue receiving emails, though I do not expect them to attend.
Jingxin Liang (now at Duke University for her MS) and Shyama Mohanty (seeking a postdoc elsewhere) should be removed from the list.
Please also remove the following addresses:
prudhvisai535@utexas.edu
mariena@utexas.edu
isakazen@utexas.edu (now focusing on her Physics degree)
At the same time, please be sure to include Mbarak on the list. Although he successfully defended on August 11, he still plans to submit his dissertation this fall semester.
 
For utruffel@utexas.edu, although he missed the summer meetings, he has contacted me about completing his Capstone Project. Let's keep him on the list.
 
Finally, please include Ziming Hu, our incoming PhD student (already added by Koutian).
